      The Shark Awards today announce that the Fresh Design Awards will be
      incorporated into The Shark Design Awards. 


      The move builds on an already established relationship with Fresh Awards
      and is part of the Shark’s desire to grow the category and promote and
      reward design that truly innovates and delivers creativity and excellence
      in all aspects.


      Peter Brady, Chairman of The Shark Awards commented: “There is no doubt
      that design, apart from being an obvious category for delivering on
      creativity and craft, is also the glue that keeps so many other categories
      together. That might seem like an overclaim, but we've come to believe
      that a lot of creative endeavours quickly come apart if you remove good
      design. So, The Shark Design Awards will continue to reward the creative
      design community and that will involve juries of respected international
      experts.”


      There are four pillars of The Shark Awards: Advertising, Design, Music
      Video and Short Film.
