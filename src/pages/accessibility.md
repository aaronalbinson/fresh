      to the widest range of visitors. This means considering the specific needs
      of those with visual or physical impairments, learning difficulties and
      other forms of disability. In addition it means having an understanding of
      different browser technologies.


      We support the principles of the ‘Disability Discrimination Act’ (1995)
      and are committed to recognising and responding to the needs of all
      disabled people. Web content accessibility
