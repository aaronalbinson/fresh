      – Packaging\

      – Branding\

      – Brand Campaigns\

      – Environmental (Shop Displays, Interiors etc)\

      – Writing for Design\

      – The Big F*


      \*Winning entries from each category will automatically be entered (free
      of charge) for the chance to win The Big F.


      Each submission is £100 + VAT and if you pay for five entries, you get the
      sixth for free.


      Entries without pre-payment will not be judged.


      Late entries are not accepted, and there are no exceptions due to the
      tight timeline.


      We are unable to return any work.


      Only Gold award winners and The Big F will receive a physical trophy.


      All decisions by our juries are final.


      ## Replica Trophies

      entrant may order a maximum of 1 copy in addition to the original. If the
      entrant wins in several categories, they are entitled to the same number.
