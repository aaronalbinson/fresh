      \*Winning entries from each category will automatically be entered (free
      of charge) for the chance to win The Big F.


      Each submission is £100 + VAT and if you pay for five entries, you get the
      sixth for free.


      Entries without pre-payment will not be judged.


      Late entries are not accepted, and there are no exceptions due to the
