      # Fresh Talent

      ## Benjamin Craven
    rparagraph: >-
      Seeing as our award is an iconic symbol for all things Fresh, it’s only
      right we give an opportunity to the freshest talent in our industry. Each
      year, the egg acts as a blank canvas for a graduate to provide a unique
      creative approach. This year, recent graduate Benjamin Craven has been
      commissioned to create the winning eggs.


      Benjamin graduated from Leeds Arts University with an Honours degree in
      Printed Textiles & Surface Pattern Design. From screen-printing to
      digital, he uses a plethora of different techniques to create a
      distinctive signature style with a focus on the everyday. 


      His work is inspired by everyday sights and occurrences, from the bright
      colours of the supermarket cleaning aisle, to architectural collisions -
      high, low, and all around. The surroundings of the day-to-day makes up his
      source of inspiration and, through his work, he sets out to encourage the
      viewer to consider playfulness in art and life. Using clashing colours and
      patterns, his heavy use of geometric lines make for a bold and dynamic
      style. 


      Since graduating, Craven has exhibited at globally renowned New Designers,
      and has collaborated with names such as Brancott Estate, Today At Apple,
      and the Hayward Gallery in London; his recent projects include working
      with BBC’s DIY SOS, and developing his own line of homeware products.
