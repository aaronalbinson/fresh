      ## Rebecca Paige
    rparagraph: >-
      Seeing as our brand new award is an iconic symbol for all things Fresh,
      it’s only right we give an opportunity to the freshest talent in our
      industry. Each year, the egg will act as a blank canvas for a graduate to
      provide a unique creative approach. This year, recent Illustration
      graduate Rebecca Paige has been commissioned to create the winning eggs. 


      Rebecca Paige is a London born, Cumbrian based Illustrator and printmaker
      and graduated from The University of Cumbria in 2018 with an Honours
      degree in Illustration. Her work explores the primitive yet equally
      intricate lives of Ancient Civilisations. 


      As a printmaker, she enjoys capturing the beauty that exists in the ruins
      of ancient societies – often taking complex and otherwise overlooked
      accounts of history and recreating them in an energetic, and engaging
      manner.
