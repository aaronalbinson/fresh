      ## Rebecca Paige
    rparagraph: >-
      Seeing as our brand new award is an iconic symbol for all things Fresh,
      it’s only right we give an opportunity to the freshest talent in our
      industry. Each year, the egg will act as a blank canvas for a graduate to
      provide a unique creative approach. This year, recent Illustration
      graduate Rebecca Paige has been commissioned to create the 2019 winning
      eggs. 


      Rebecca is a London born, Cumbrian based Illustrator and printmaker and
      graduated from The University of Cumbria in 2018 with an Honours degree in
      Illustration. Her work explores the primitive yet equally intricate lives
      of ancient civilisations. 


      As a printmaker who usually works with linocut, Rebecca enjoys capturing
      the beauty that exists in the ruins of ancient societies – often taking
      complex and otherwise overlooked accounts of history and recreating them
      in an energetic, and engaging manner. 


      Since graduating last year, her work has been exhibited at globally
      renowned New Designers and she has worked on a number of commissions, as
      well as creating countless new prints.

      industry's freshest talents.
