      Multi-award winning London branding agency Rose has scooped no less than 3
      coveted Gold eggs, in the 2019 Fresh Awards – the benchmark for fresh
      thinking in design and branding.


      Their innovative take on a sector saturated with me-too offerings, where
      short term gains, and trends set by the market leaders have dictated the
      majority of brands for years, really resonated with the Fresh jury of
      internationally respected Creative Directors. The agency and their client
      won gold in the Re-branding, Poster Campaign, and Best use of Illustration
      categories.


      The strategic thinking for 10bet was born from observations and insights
      from the consumer perspective that most sports book operators present
      customers with confusing UIs and frustrating UXs. The competitor landscape
      also appears to draw on the same visual language, vocabulary and
      promotional offers. Library photography of sports stars is used almost
      across the board, resulting in poorly executed montages, where faces,
      badges and sponsors logos require extensive retouching to fulfill the
      increased regulatory controls and governance within the UK gaming
      industry.


      So Rose helped <a href="http://10bet.co.uk" target="_blank">10bet</a>
      define a refreshingly simple strategic approach. One which aims to put the
      needs of their audience - the bettor - before the bookie. As a result,
      their visual and verbal language has been reinvented to give 10bet much
      needed differentiation within the market, supporting their new positioning
      – ‘For the bettor’ – by making the customer experience quicker, easier,
      more intuitive and more enjoyable, as well as increasing recognition and
      relevance through the special relationship the sports world has with the
      number 10. This is where our judges got really excited!


      10bet launched their new brand with a campaign at ICE, the major annual
      industry trade show at ExCel in London’s Docklands. The campaign draws all
      its inspiration from the number 10 shirt – the most coveted shirt in
      football. Using current famous number 10s from top European teams to drive
      fans to the 10bet app and website, the campaign posters present odds on
      the likelihood of their heroes winning the golden boot (the most goals
      scored) at the end of the season. But the number 10 in each case has been
      replaced by the 10bet logo – ensuring the brand is recognized as owning
      the most prized number in football, as well as creating immediate impact
      and brand recognition for the business, in a solution our judges felt
      really stood out from the crowds.


      In response to the issue of stock photography, the agency also delivered
      an ingenious solution in the form of a library of more than 100
      customisable illustrations, with interchangeable features, hair, skin
      tones and kits to create an infinite asset bank of distinctive, ownable
      10bet images for long term, license-free, use in application – saving the
      client both money and time.


      So not just one, but three different aspects of a rebranding project the
      jury chose to reward for smart thinking and clever execution.
