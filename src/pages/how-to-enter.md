      Sincere thanks to everyone who has entered the Fresh Awards to date (and
      we salute all of our early birds) but we have made the decision to push
      back the deadline to Thursday 23 April 2020.


      Judging was set to take place during week commencing 30 March in both
      London and Leeds, but given the issues surrounding the coronavirus
      outbreak, we have decided to postpone our plans and we will review again
      in due course - and keep you posted. 


      This decision was made in consultation with our two great juries (Regional
      & London) and whilst we have considered judging online and remotely,
      nothing beats a good face to face debate. Ultimately, we may have no
      choice but to adopt this route, but we thought it sensible for now to
      delay. The good news is that anyone panicking about entering has much
      longer to get their work sorted. 


      Our fabulous trophies are all sorted and ready to go, so we are not
      cancelling Fresh, just delaying the programme whilst closely monitoring
      the ongoing situation. Details about the winners announcements, will be
      confirmed in due course.


      All Best Wishes & Stay Safe

      We’re keeping it simple, and going a little green here at Fresh, and will
      be asking for online entries only in a PDF format. If you have a physical
      entry that you want to submit to back up your online submission, then
      please include these details with your submission and we can provide
      details of where to send the work for the actual judging. We are unable to
      return any of these items, so please think carefully about physical work –
      although we do understand that some entries are best judged by touch and
      feel.
