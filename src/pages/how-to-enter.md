      We’re keeping it simple, and going a little green here at Fresh, and will
      be asking for online entries only in a PDF format. If you have a physical
      entry that you want to submit to back up your online submission, then
      please include these details with your submission and we can provide
      details of where to send the work for the actual judging. We are unable to
      return any of these items, so please think carefully about physical work –
      although we do understand that some entries are best judged by touch and
      feel.
