      One of the iconic strengths of Fresh being independent and run for passion
      not profit, is that it is always looking at new ways to ensure that strong
      creativity is embraced and rewarded irrespective of where it has
      originated from. For Fresh 2020, we’re taking a step forward to address
      the balance between the regions and London, and having two juries, one
      outside of the M25 to judge the work originating from London, and one in
      London responsible for awarding the regional work. None of our judges will
      get a say on their own work – and only the very best will emerge with one
      of our beautiful coveted eggs. How Fresh is your creativity? Let the
      battle commence...
